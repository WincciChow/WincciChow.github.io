<p>Using React-Redux for a weather forecast web App maybe a bit overkilled. I just used this classic react assignment to demonstrate my knowledge of React-Redux and canvas.
<br><br> This project is still ongoing. I am working on how to use canvas in React to make the background change according to different weather conditions! </p>
