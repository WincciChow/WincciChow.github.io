<p>Using React-Redux for a weather forecast web application maybe a bit overkilled. But I just use this classic react project to demonstrates my knowledge of React-Redux and responsive design.
<br><br> This project is still ongoing. I am working on how to use canvas in React. So that I can make the background change according to different weather conditions! </p>
