<p>Crepe Me Up is an mobile app UI design work for online ordering crepe cakes. I adopted macaron color scheme since it is a symbol of sweetness.The color complements each other magnificently. I also did POP testing and wireframe design for this project.
   
 <br><br>I used Sketch for the User Interface Design part and created interactive mockup by InVision. UI Design and Style Guildlines are showcaseing here.</p>
