<p>Crepe Me Up is an mobile app UI design work for online ordering of crepe cakes. I adopted macaron color scheme since it is a symbol of sweetness.The color complements each other magnificently. I also did POP testing and wireframe design for this project.
   
 <br><br>I used Sketch for the Uer Interface Design part and created interactive mockup by InVision. You can check up the prototyping from this link on InVision. UI Design and Style Guildlines are showcaseing as followings.</p>
