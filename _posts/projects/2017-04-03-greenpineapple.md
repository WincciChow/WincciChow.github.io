<p>Be winccible is an online model porfolio project. I am personally a commercial model. So I am developing this porfolio for myself and adapt to my name "Wincci". It has a very creative fold out navigation along with the hamburger menu. Large type in web design is applied too.
   
  <br><br> This project demonstrates my learning of SCSS development and UI design principles. </p>
