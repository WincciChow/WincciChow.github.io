description: I completed the User Interface Design Program from Brainstation. In this program, I learnt the practice of transforming user goals and requirements into beautiful, intuitive, and functional digital interfaces. BrainStation's User Interface Design Certificate Course uses a collaborative, project-based learning model that mimics what UI Designers experience in the field. By the end of the course, I built engaging websites and applications, with a firm grasp of leading design principles, best practices, and first-hand experience with Sketch and InVision. </br> I also obtained a certificate of Responsive Web Design from freeCodeCamp E-learning and I still continue learing more front end technologies and skills from online study. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/winccizhou">my freeCodeCamp profile</a>.
